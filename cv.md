### Desired Position: Front-End Developer

### Contact info: andrewbond@mail.ru

My goal is to learn programming and become a developer in the near future. I graduated from a university with a degree in linguistics and currently, I work as a pre-sales/support operator for a company that develops and sells software solutions.

Last year I developed a passion for programming and started learning HTML/CSS; however, I know that those skills **are not** sufficient to become a successful programmer and land a job. I want to be a front-end developer who is very comfortable with JavaScript, React and other popular frameworks. I’ve been learning JavaScript on my own for a few months and I think that RS school can jumpstart my career as a developer and the mentor will guide me along my way, provide valuable tips and advice, answer some of my questions, and eventually lead me to success – which is, in my understanding, landing my first job. I am a passionate learner and I will not let you down. I am like a sponge willing to absorb all the useful information RS school has for me.

- Skills:

- HTML/CSS/SCSS

- JavaScript

- Superficial React skills

- Basic Git

- OOP/Classes

- ES-6

### Work Experience

Unfortunately, I have not done any commercial development, therefore, I don’t have any commercial work experience. However, I have completed quite a few pet projects, did some html/css layouts, tic-tac-toe game and some React projects by following the tutorials and repeating all the steps.

### Learning Curve

As I was learning on my own, I discovered a range of highly useful resources online. Below are the ones I used extensively and the ones which have raised my skills to a new level:

- FreeCodeCamp

- CodeWars

- CodeAcademy

- HTML Academy

- YouTube Channels

- Articles

### English Skills

In my line of work, I use English at work to communicate with customers. We exchange emails, chat using a live-messanger. I also participate in phone calls with customers where we discuss their business, ideas, preferences; I also answer their questions about the products that my company is selling. My level of English is advanced and I keep practicing it by reading books and watching movies/TV series in English.
