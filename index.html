            <p>
              My goal is to learn programming and become a developer in the near
              future. I graduated from a university with a degree in linguistics
              and was a pre-sales/support operator for a company that develops
              and sells software solutions.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Last year I developed a passion for programming and started
              learning HTML/CSS; however, I know that those skills are not
              sufficient to become a successful programmer and land a job. I
              want to be a front-end developer who is very comfortable with
              JavaScript, React and other popular frameworks. I’ve been learning
              JavaScript on my own for a few months and I think that RS school
              can jumpstart my career as a developer and the mentor will guide
              me along my way, provide valuable tips and advice, answer some of
              my questions, and eventually lead me to success – which is, in my
              understanding, landing my first job. I am a passionate learner and
              I will not let you down. I am like a sponge willing to absorb all
              the useful information RS school has for me.

              I have not done any commercial development, therefore, I don’t
              have any commercial work experience. However, I have completed
              quite a few pet projects, did some html/css layouts, tic-tac-toe
              game and some React projects by following the tutorials and
              repeating all the steps.

              In my line of work, I use English at work to communicate with
              customers. We exchange emails, chat using a live-messanger. I also
              participate in phone calls with customers where we discuss their
              business, ideas, preferences, I also answer their questions about
              the products that my company is selling. My level of English is
              advanced and I keep practicing it by reading books and watching
              movies/TV series in English.

              My goal is to become a front-end developer in a year. I know there
              is a lot of work ahead and many things to learn, but I am willing
              to commit to studying on a daily basis. If you choose me and
              become my mentor, I won’t let you down, I’ll make you proud.
